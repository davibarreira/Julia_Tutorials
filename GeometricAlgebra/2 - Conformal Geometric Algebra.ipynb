    "Topology is concerned with preserving connectivity (e.g. number of holes), while\n",
    "conformal geometry is concerned with preserving angles.\n",

    "When modelling geometric objects, we can deal with different levels of abstraction. For example,\n",
    "if we want to create a type \"Triangle\" that encapsulates all triangles, what is the \"correct\" equivalence\n",
    "class to use for such modelling? We know that, from the start, a triangle has three vertices with v1\n",
    "connected to v2, v2 connected to v3 and v1. From an topological perspective, this view is yet lacking. We don't\n",
    "know if the triangle is filled or not, hence, it could either have one hole or zero holes. For our case,\n",
    "let's suppose that a triangle is filled, i.e. it's a simpicial complex of $[v1,v2,v3,[v1,v2], [v2,v3],[v3,v1],[v1,v2,v3]]$.\n",
    "Once this is defined, then we've characterized triangles topologically. Yet, note that, topologically, a triangle is the same\n",

    "Our goal is to model 3D space in a way that conformal transformations can be algebraically represented. Besides the algebraic\n",
    "representation, we want our transformations to be covariant, in the sense that applying one conformal transformation preserves\n",
    "the algebraic structure of our object. This can be achieved by using the Conformal Geometric Algebra Model (CGA).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we actually represent the existing objects as living in a 5D space,\n",
    "i.e. we use two extra dimensions in order to better distinguish objects.\n",
    "For example, a vector in 3D space could be modeled as an array with three entries.\n",
    "In a similar manner, a point in space could also be modeled in the same way.\n",
    "The problem becomes that we cannot distinguish between a point and a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Conformal Model in an $\\mathbb R^{3+1,1}$ multivector space.\n",
    "In this model, we thus have the following base vectors $\\{e_1,e_2,e_3,e_-, e_+\\}$.\n",
    "The first three are the base vectors of the actual space, while the last two\n",
    "are special base vectors, where $e_-^2= -1$. Note that, in the Conformal Model, we actually use\n",
    "a slightly different base. Instead of $e_-$ and $e_+$ we use\n",
