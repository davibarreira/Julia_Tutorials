    "# **1 - Introduction to Geometric Algebra via Julia**\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric Algebra is about working with \"vector spaces\" together with a special\n",
    "product operator, called geometric product.\n",
    "If you have a physics or engineering background, you've probably know\n",
    "inner products and vector products. Yet, when studying a mathematics book \n",
    "on Linear Algebra, it's common for authors to avoid the vector product all together.\n",
    "One possible reason for this is that the vector product does no seem as natural as the inner product.\n",
    "For example, one does not have a vector product in 2D spaces. This begs the question, what \"exactly\" is\n",
    "this vector product?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is a bit more convoluted that one might wish, yet, also much more fruitful. The answer to this\n",
    "lies in what is called Geometric Algebra. In Geometric Algebra, as we've said, we introduce\n",
    "a new product, called geometric product. This product exists for all dimensions, and it\n",
    "generalizes both inner product AND vector product.\n",
    "Yet, for this to work, we have to introduce some new constructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Linear Algebra deals with vectors, Geometric Algebra deals with multivectors.\n",
    "A multivector is a generalization of a vector. While vectors are only \"arrows\", a multivector\n",
    "can be an arrow, but it can also be a plane or a volume.\n",
    "Let's do an example. Consider we have a vector space in $\\mathbb R^3$, with\n",
    "bases $\\mathbf e_1, \\mathbf e_2, \\mathbf e_3$.\n",
    "While a vector is a linear combination of our vector bases, e.g.\n",
    "$\\alpha \\mathbf e_1 + \\beta \\mathbf e_2 +  \\gamma \\mathbf e_3$,\n",
    "a multivector \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is what is called a blade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Outer (Exterior) Product\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $V$ be a vector space. Then, a blade $B$ is just a vector subspace of $V$, i.e. \n",
    "if $v_1, v_2 \\in B$, then for any scalars $\\alpha, \\beta$, we have $\\alpha v_1 + \\beta v_2 \\in B$, which implies that\n",
    "$B$ is also a vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to somehow manipulate these blades (subspaces), and do algebra with them, similar to how we do algebra with vectors (e.g. we can sum vectors\n",
    "and so on). One way to do this is to describe how these subspaces are generated. Hence, we introduce the **outer (exterior) product**.\n",
    "This product is denoted by the wedge operator $\\wedge$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the outer product is that for two vectors $v,u \\in V$, $v \\wedge u$ represents the weighted subspace generated\n",
    "by these two vectors. These subspaces are \"weighted\" because $\\alpha v \\wedge u$ generates the same subspace, where\n",
    "$\\alpha$ is a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the outer product defines vector subspaces, it must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Associative: $v \\wedge (u \\wedge w) = (v \\wedge u) \\wedge w)$,\n",
    "* Commutative with the scalars: $v \\wedge \\alpha u = \\alpha (v \\wedge u)$,\n",
    "* Distributive: $v \\wedge (u + w) = v \\wedge u  + v \\wedge w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, if we want to somehow encode the orientation of the subspace (e.g. the orientation of a plane),\n",
    "we have to add one last property:\n",
    "* Antisymmetry: $v \\wedge u = - u \\wedge v$, which implies $v \\wedge v = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, if these vectors are colinear (i.e. $u = \\alpha v$ for some scalar $\\alpha$), we want\n",
    "the outer product to be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this outer product to generalize the idea of a vector, and define $k$-vectors.\n",
    "The $k$ represents the \"grade\"of the multivector, which is the same as the dimension of the spanned subspace.\n",
    "A $k$-vector is the linear combination of *simple* $k$-vectors, also known as $k$-blades.\n",
    "A $k$-blade is a $k$-vector that can be written as the outer product of $1$-vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a 4 dimensional vector space $V$. In this vector space, we define the base vectors\n",
    "to be $e_1,...,e_4$. Thus, an example of a $2$-blade would be $2 e_1 \\wedge e_2$, and an example\n",
    "of a $2$-vector (bivector) would be $1 e_3 \\wedge e_4 + 2 e_1 \\wedge e_2$.\n",
    "Note that our bivector cannot be factored in terms of a wedge product. To see that,\n",
    "consider instead the following bivcecto $e_1 \\wedge e_2 + e_2 \\wedge e_3$. This one\n",
    "can be written as $(e_1 - e_3) \\wedge e_2$, thus, it's a $2$-blade.\n",
