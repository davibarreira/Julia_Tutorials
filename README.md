# Julia Tutorials
### A repository for interesting Tutorials in Julia.
Since Julia is still a "new" language, there is not as much material
out there, with easy to follow tutorials on how to do many things. Hence,
this is a personal repository to congregate Tutorials in Julia, mainly
focused on Mathematics/ Machine Learning. Other interesting and related
subjects will also be present here.

This repository is related to the publication [Coffee in a Klein Bottle](https://medium.com/coffee-in-a-klein-bottle).

Below, a List of Contets:
* [Speeding Up Julia Precompilation](https://github.com/davibarreira/Julia_Tutorials/tree/main/Speeding_up_Julia_Precompilation) - How to use PackageCompiler.jl
to create precompiled versions of Julia with your favorite packages, and speed up the process of starting a new kernel;
* [Deep Learning with Julia](https://github.com/davibarreira/Julia_Tutorials) - A brief tutorial on training a Neural Network with Flux.jl.The notebook [here](https://github.com/davibarreira/Julia_Tutorials/blob/main/MachineLearning/Flux_Tutorial1.ipynb) corresponds to the code shown in the article;
* [Analyzing Graphs with Julia](https://medium.com/coffee-in-a-klein-bottle/analyzing-graphs-with-julia-38e26d1d2f62) - A brief tutorial on how to use Julia to analyze graphs using the JuliaGraphs packages. The notebook [here](https://github.com/davibarreira/Julia_Tutorials/blob/main/Graphs/Graphs_Tutorial.ipynb) corresponds to the code shown in the article.
