    "The multiple-dispatch capability of Julia makes design patterns in Julia quite different. First of all, Julia\n",
    "does not have classes. Instead, it has Structs, which can be thought of as composite \"types\", on which\n",
    "functions can be written in order to transform such struct. Hence, a struct is not like a class where one defines methods,\n",
    "but it's more like an \"pure\" object with properties, and to which functions are applied to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, while in OOP a class will generate objects that have \"methods\" inside of it. In Julia, there are no methods, it's all functions.\n",
    "And these functions are separated from the structs.\n",
    "The way we tie them together is via multiple dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example might make things clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the family of geometric shapes.\n",
    "Each object will be a shape, such as a square, a rectangle, a triangle, and so on. While the functions\n",
    "will take shapes and perform some action.\n"
