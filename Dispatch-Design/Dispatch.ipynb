    "# **On Dispatching Design Patters**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have experience with Object Oriented Programming languages such as Python, you might\n",
    "find strange the way packages are implemented in Julia. For example, Julia does not have classes!\n",
    "Hence, you might wonder how you should design your code, since you probably won't be creating\n",
    "classes with methods, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple-dispatch capability of Julia makes design patterns in Julia quite different. First of all,\n",
    "in Julia, instead, of classes we only have structs.\n",
    "The struct can be thought of as composite \"types\", on which\n",
    "functions can be written in order to transform such struct. Besides structs, we have abstract types,\n",
    "which provide a hierarchy to the many types in Julia, and help to properly dispatch function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, a struct is not like a class where one defines methods,\n",
    "but it's more like a \"concrete\" type to which functions are applied to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, while in OOP a class will generate objects that have \"methods\" inside of it.\n",
    "In Julia, there are no methods, it's all functions.\n",
    "These functions are separated from the structs, and\n",
    "the way we tie them together is via multiple dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example might make things clearer. At first, let's create a struct to store 2D coordinate points.\n"
