    "## 1. Defining Adjunctions\n",
    "In a category, we usually say that two objects are \"the same\" if they are isomorphic in a categorical sense.\n",
    "This means that $A \\cong B$ if there exists a morphism $f:A \\to B$ that is invertible, i.e.\n",
    "there exists $g:B \\to A$  such that $g \\circ f = id_A$ and $f \\circ g = id_B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember now the category $\\mathbf{Cat}$ of small categories. Here, the objects\n",
    "are small categories, and the morphisms are functors.\n",
    "This category is said to be a 2-category, because we can define natural transformations\n",
    "between functors. Hence, functors are morphisms and natural transformations are 2-morphisms (since they\n",
    "act as morphisms between morphisms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we say that two small categories $\\mathcal C$ and $\\mathcal D$ are ismorphic in $\\mathbf{Cat}$\n",
    "if there exists an invertible functor $F:\\mathcal C \\to \\mathcal D$, i.e.\n",
    "there exists a functor $G: \\mathcal D \\to \\mathcal C$ such that $G \\circ F = I_\\mathcal C$ and $F \\circ G = I_\\mathcal D$\n",
    "where $I_\\mathcal C$ and $I_\\mathcal D$ are the identity endofunctors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the same logic, we can say\n",
    "that two functors $F$ and $G$ are (naturally) isomorphic if there exists an invertible natural transformation\n",
    "$\\alpha: F \\Rightarrow G$. And we now can say that $\\mathcal C$ and $\\mathcal D$ are **equivalent**\n",
    "if there exists a functor that is *almost* invertible, meaning, there exists a functor\n",
    "$F: \\mathcal C \\to \\mathcal D$ such that there exists $G$ for which\n",
    "$G \\circ F \\cong I_\\mathcal C$ and $F \\circ G \\cong I_\\mathcal D$, i.e.\n",
    "they are naturally isomorphic to the identity functors.\n",
    "Note that **equivalence** is weaker than **isomorphism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going further with this same logic, we can define an even weaker notion of \"equallity\" than equivalence.\n",
    "This notion is called **adjuction**. The idea now is that a category $\\mathcal C$ is adjoint to\n",
    "a category $\\mathcal D$ is there exists a functor that is *almost almost* (twice almost) invertible.\n",
    "This is, there exists a functor $F:\\mathcal C \\to \\mathcal D$ and\n",
    "there exists a functor $G:\\mathcal D \\to \\mathcal C$, such that\n",
    "$G \\circ F \\approx I_\\mathcal C$ and $F\\circ G \\approx I_\\mathcal D$, meaning,\n",
    "$G \\circ F$ is *almost* naturally isomorphic to the identity functors... But what does\n",
    "\"almost naturally isomorphic\" means? It means that there exists a natural transformation\n",
    "$\\varepsilon: G \\circ F \\Rightarrow I_\\mathcal C$ and a natural transformation $\\eta :I_\\mathcal D \\Rightarrow F \\circ G$,\n",
    "and they are *almost* inverses of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean for $\\eta$ and $\\varepsilon$ to be almost inverses? Specially since they have different\n",
    "domain and codomains? This \"almost inverses\" means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\varepsilon_{Gd}\\circ G\\eta_d = \\text{id}_{Gd}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F\\varepsilon_{c}\\circ \\eta{Fc} = \\text{id}_{Fc},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $F \\varepsilon$ and $G \\eta$ are the horizontal compositions for\n",
    "$I_{\\mathcal D}$ with $\\varepsilon$ and $I_\\mathcal{C}$ with $\\eta$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the definition creates an assymetry. The existence of\n",
    "$\\eta: G \\circ F \\Rightarrow I_\\mathcal C$\n",

    "$\\varepsilon: I_\\mathcal D \\Rightarrow F \\circ G$\n",
    "does not imply the existence of natural transformations in the other directions, e.g. $I_\\mathcal C \\Rightarrow G \\circ F$.\n",
    "Hence, in the case described above, we say that $F$ is a **left adjoint** of $\\mathcal C$ to $\\mathcal D$\n",
    "and that $G$ is the **right adjoint**.\n",
