    "We start with a definition of **Function Programming (FP)**. It is a programming paradigm characterized by\n",
    "the use of **pure functions** and the avoidance of **side effects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are **pure functions**? In programming, a pure function is a function that depends *only* on it's arguments,\n",
    "such that it always returns the same value if the same same arguments are passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are **side effects**? A side effect is anything that a function does that affects the \"outside\"/\"global scope\". For example,\n",
    "consider the following function:"

    "\n",
    "In FP, every chunk of code can be classified in Data, Calculation or Action.\n",
    "Actions are usually pieces of code that result in side-effects, and thus, it matters when and how\n",
    "many times such piece of code is used. For example, a function `sendemail()` would be an Action,\n",
